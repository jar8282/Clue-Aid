# Clue-Aid
A tool that aims to take the brain-power to playing the Clue board game to 0.

**Problem:** I'm very bad at Clue.

**Solution:** Using this tool.


***Version 1.0 Goal:***
It will be a basic command-line program, which takes in user input for each 'round'.
There will not be error handling yet for inputting/checking strings.
Essentially, it will be connecting all the dots when players ask questions and get handed cards,
and using preexisting knowledge to get the answer faster than I could by myself.


***Unrealistic 2.0 Goal:***
Use my fledgling web-dev skills to make a gui and add it to a page on my website.
This version won't need string error handling, as user input will be button based (tentatively).
